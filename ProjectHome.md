GWT-REST is an asynchronous RESTful client implementation for GWT.

GWT-REST can be used alongside GWT-RPC or as a replacement for it. The intent is to provide a drop-in solution for communicating with REST web services that may or may not be implemented in Java.

A set of generic interfaces is provided along with implementations for JSON and Rails in this first release.

Until a user guide is ready, see the [README](http://gwt-rest.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/README) for a quick overview and the [Javadocs](http://kaboomerang.com/javadocs/gwt-rest/) for more detail.
